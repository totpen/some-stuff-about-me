# 👋 Hola! Soy Agustín, también conocido como Totti.

#### I'm a 23-year-old developer padawan from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I started my journey into coding a few months ago with HTML & CSS for website development. After been able to handle fully responsive website design, I jumped into JavaScript, which I'm still learning and practising everyday, as well as some back-end languages like Python and SQL.

Apart from coding, I'm amazed with all the crypto environment and I've been working in the Data Analytics area since 2018 and as a freelancer doing a variety of projects such as community management, data visualizations, analytics, site-tagging and creative design.
