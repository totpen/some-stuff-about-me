# 👋 Hola! I am Agustin, also known as Totti

### I'm a 24-year-old developer padawan from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

I started my journey into coding a few months ago with HTML & CSS for website development. After been able to handle fully responsive website design, I jumped into JavaScript. I also know some backend-languages like Python (pretty basic though) and SQL.

Besides coding, I'm amazed with all the crypto environment and I've been working in the Data Analytics area since 2018 and as a freelancer doing a variety of projects such as community management, data visualizations, analytics, site-tagging and creative design.

- 🤓 Started my journey down the web3 rabbit hole.
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate here in GitHub and expand my professional network.
- 📞 You can contact me through Linkedin [@agustinpensotti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/agust%C3%ADnpensotti/)
- 🎲 Random stuff about me: I'm a musician and I love mountains, lakes and hiking ⛰
